# Premier Manager 2 Legacy

## Prelude
This is my attempt at porting a staple of my childhood, Premier Manager 2.
Basically, I aim to revitalize the DOS version of the very best soccer manager
game before Championship Manager took over in the early 90s. Actually, truth be
told, I was always terrible at this game, but it provided me the incentive to
start playing with hex editors and disassemblers, so I could cheat at the game,
which in turn set me on a lifelong career.

Anyway, this port tries to be as similar as possible to the original gameplay.
In fact, to run this port, the assets (from the original DOS game) need to be
extracted and placed in the assets directory.

## Directory Structure
Tools - A bunch of tools used in the development of the port. Some in Python,
some in C.
Assets - Where the original PM2 files need to go.
